    <p id = 'more'> 
        In an interview, the artist Sumiko Arai revealed that the idea for The Guy She Was 
        Interested in Wasn't a Guy At All came from her fascination with stories about girls 
        from different backgrounds forming connections. She started to post short stories of the series on Twitter
        with the use of black and a vibrant yellow-green (instead of the usual black-and-white colors
        for Japanese mangas due to physical publishment costs), which adds a visually striking element to the story.

        This art style was definitely the first element that caught my interest in the manga, but I ended up
        loving how light-hearted this manga is. When Aya found out that Mitsuki is actually a 
        girl and her classmate, she was upset that Mitsuki has been lying to her, but her crush 
        on Mitsuki still remains the same and was never changed because Mitsuki is a girl. Their relationship 
        is the ultimate dream for a high school girl falling in love for the first time and I'm all for it! The artist
        also did a really great job in letting readers enjoy the whole experience with official 
        playlists and in their concept making in pop-up events, manga publishment, drama CD,... The artist 
        just recently announced an anime adaptation in production for the series, and I'm very excited to see 
        this in full action!
